# SheCodesChallenge-PetLandingPage

The Challenge was to create a Landing Page with the theme: Your Pet.
It was only possbile to submit a valid and single HTML file, including the content related to the challenge theme. 
The HTML file must contain the HTML code, CSS code, and, optionally, JavaScript code. 
It's only possible to submit one HTML file, so multi-page websites are not admittable.

I made my site on Ants🐜🐜🐜. I used the following to make my site stand out:
- Video on ants
- Ant animations
- Ant Youtube video embed
- Inline styling
- Bootstrap Cards, navbar and footer
